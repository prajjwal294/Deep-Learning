In this project we have implemented LSTM-MSNet model on M4 forecasting data. We have used PyTorch to develop our model. But before its implementation we have performed all the necessary steps of pre-processing of time series data. 
Please go through the jupyter notebook, I have mentioned description of each step in text cells.
