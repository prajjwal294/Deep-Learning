The project is based on the implementation of the UNET model on Geospatial data. For this project, we have used CDS open-source data. 
The purpose of developing the UNET model was to predict the 3rd parameter from two known parameters.
Before the implementation of the UNET model, we performed some of the data analysis techniques. 
Also since the image of geospatial data is quite large in size we have focussed on implementation instead of results (lack of computation power)
