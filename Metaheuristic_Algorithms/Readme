Here we have written two codes, both for the inversion of Gravity data. 

In both the programs we are trying to in find the unknown parameters of a fault using bouguer anomaly data (those who are not from
earth science background google it for more theoretical idea about it).

Also a pdf doc is attached to know how PSO works.
