In this program we are trying to detect 7 unknown parameters (4 unknown velocities and 3 unknown thickness of each layer) via simple ANN architecture. 

Predicting Sesimic velocity along with the depth of layers is a typical geophysical problem.
We have generated the synthetic data on our own. 
The ANN was trained on 100,000 datasets and an accuracy of ~91% was achieved.
